# Update Value After Decimal

Assuming you are using MySQL, you can use the RAND() function to generate a random decimal number between 0 and 99, and then update the transaction table as follows:

    UPDATE transaction
    SET amount = FLOOR(amount) + RAND() * 100
    WHERE extra1 = 'SEED';

This query will select all the rows in the transaction table where the extra1 column is equal to 'SEED', and then update the amount column for each row by setting the part after the decimal point to a random value between 0 and 99.

Note that the FLOOR() function is used to round down the original amount value to the nearest integer, which effectively removes the original decimal part. The RAND() function then generates a random decimal value between 0 and 1, which is multiplied by 100 to produce a random value between 0 and 100. This value is then added to the rounded down integer value, resulting in a new decimal value with a random part between 0 and 99.

It is possible to keep the current value before the decimal point and only update the value after the decimal point as follows:

    UPDATE transaction
    SET amount = CONCAT(FLOOR(amount), '.', LPAD(FLOOR(RAND()*100), 2, '0'))
    WHERE extra1 = 'SEED';

This query will update the amount column in the transaction table for all rows where extra1 is equal to 'SEED'. The CONCAT() function is used to combine the current integer value of the amount column (which is obtained by applying the FLOOR() function to the original value) with a new decimal value. The new decimal value is generated by first generating a random integer between 0 and 99 using the RAND() function, and then formatting it with LPAD() to ensure that it has exactly two digits (e.g., 03 instead of 3). This formatted value is then concatenated with the integer part of the original amount value to produce the new amount value.
